SubOSM - Obtain useful data about the Buenos Aires Subte from OpenStreetMap
===========================================================================

This is a hobby project to extract useful information about the Buenos
Aires Subte network from OSM. The objective is to find "hard" facts to
back observations about the network.

Examples would include:

- a map with the city colored by walking distance to the nearest
  subway station,
- a map with the city colored by the closet subway station,
- a map showing the number of train changes required for "typical"
  travel ("typical" would need some definition),
- a map showing typical travel times ("typical" would need some
  definition).

The same approach could be applied to other cities, which would then
allow a comparison of the different networks.
